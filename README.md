# List of Todos

1. Go through the first 3 examples until you understand what is going on and how it works.
2. Complete Project:
   the example code files should contain everything you need to do to get it working

   1. Create a file in examples called project_1.py
   2. Create a rectangle that is 100x50 big and is drawn at the coordinates (200, 400), use the sprite class for this
   3. Listen for movement and move the rectangle 2 pixels on every arrow key press

3. The basic game logic is done, but in the game inside the v1 folder, we need to add a few things:
   1. A timer to use as a score, it should restart everytime the game restarts
   2. sprite images to show a character, a better platform, and different barrel objects for each type
   3. The score should be displayed if it is above 0 on the intro screen
   4. Music needs to be added
   5. Tweak speed and timing to make the game hard enough to be interesting
